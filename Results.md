## CSC 510 Project 3

---
Observations from the 2nd lab conducted on 10 participants from CSC 510 Fall 2020.

---
**NOTE**

Given the complexity of the application, we did not ask the lab participants to setup the bot on their local, and instead provided them with a ready setup. To access the ease of setup from a developer's perspective, we instead explained them all the steps involved in setup and asked them to answer survey questions based on their understanding of software development and the information provided during the session.

### Question: How long did it take for you test the bot (Including the time taken to explain the steps required to setup the bot in lieu of actual setup)

* The time reported here is in minutes.
As you can see the minimum time reported by the participants for testing the bot is 14 mins and the maximum time reported by the participants for testing the bot is 30 mins and the average time is around 22 mins

### Question: Having explained the steps required to setup the bot on your machine, how much time do you expect it would take?

### Question: How easy is the setup on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest?

### Question: Did the bot crash during your testing?

### Question: If the bot was relased for use, with appropriate use case, how likely are you to use this product, 1 being unlikely and 5 being very likely?

### Question: How was your overall experience using the bot on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being least likely and 5 being most likely. Would you recommend its usage to others?

## Threats to Validity

Given the limited number of test subjects, the results are not very conclusive. A large number of subjects would need to be surveyed in order to identify the viability of the bot. <br />
There is a high chance that the reported responses from participants may not have been timed accurately during which the experiment was conducted.
